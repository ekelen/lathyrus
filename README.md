# ▽ Lathyrus ▽

Another mobile-friendly React game, which makes less use of the [Newton Sans](https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/reference/font.do) font than I would have liked.

Also featuring:

- Homemade [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) config with some neat plugins
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Vectors from [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)
- The delightful [React InlineSVG](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-inlinesvg) component/loader
